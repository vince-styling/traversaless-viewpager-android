# Traversaless ViewPager

This branch was create for screen recording, I slow down two widget's scroll duration to make
people explicitly see the different between my widget and lastest(now is 4.4_r1) widget.

Don't spend time is this branch, it just a temporary place to store my code.

As record, I used `SCR ScreenRecorder 0.14.4-beta` to capture my app integration video,
used [ezgif](http://ezgif.com/add-text/gif_360x379_dca82a.gif) to convert the MP4 to gif,
and [zamzar](http://www.zamzar.com/) also be a good choice.
