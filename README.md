# Traversaless ViewPager

Traversaless(traversal less) ViewPager was born as an enhance ViewPager, it's mission was to solve the scroll
too much problem for me, but I believe this problem also share with others, so I made this project and release it.

![integration with different](/integration_with_different.gif "integration with different")

# What's the problem

Let's say we have five pages inside the ViewPager, now the first page is shown, after that, we click the corresponding button
of last page intend to switch from first page directly to last page, this time the scroll animation start to play but it go through
the second page and the third page and the fourth page, finally reach to the last page. and if we used the `FragmentStatePagerAdapter`
which you knew it's principle, you'll saw the `third page` appear but being **destroy** after the scrolling done.
what's the point, we just going to last page, you create the innocent page for scroll then destroy it? let's consider this :
"does these irrelevant page(s) would cause unexpected GC or influence the scroll animation smoothly?", the answer is fairly positive.
I'd like to change this behavior, that was why we achieved this component.

# Test Case

Because original ViewPager was complicated and rich-features, so I do it carefully and write enough testcases to prove my customization is unproblematic,
also bring some performance improvements, the testcase APK will show you all my job and make you trust it's worth to live in your project.

Please download and install the pre-built [testcase APK](traversaless-viewpager-testcase-4.0.1_r1.apk) file to examine in action.

# Integration

Download the [latest JAR](http://repository.sonatype.org/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=central-proxy&g=com.vincestyling&a=traversaless-viewpager&v=LATEST)
or depend it via **Maven** :

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vincestyling</groupId>
    <artifactId>traversaless-viewpager</artifactId>
    <version>4.0.1_r1</version>
</dependency>
```

For **Gradle** projects use :

```groovy
compile 'com.vincestyling:traversaless-viewpager:(4.0.1_r1)'
```

Note : this widget was depended by `android-support-v4.jar` to build,
can't work without it, you should add the support jar into your libraries.

# Usage

The usage have nothing change, only the package location, enjoy it like you do with ViewPager before.

# Undergo

This widget base on android-support-v4 `4.0.1_r1` version, when I try to make clear how it work,
I realize it's bit complicated than I unable to fully get it mind, so I split the source code as two classes,
put those code who weren't doing scroll animation behind, cooperate with the IDE debugger, I make this purpose come true.

# Development

If you want to compile this project, you should make the `android-support-v4.jar` as library or install it into the maven repository :

```bash
mvn install:install-file
    -Dfile=lib/android-support-v4.jar
    -DgroupId=com.google.android
    -DartifactId=support-v4
    -Dversion=4.4.2_r1
    -DgeneratePom=true
    -Dpackaging=jar
```
